# QuaNet
A recurrent neural network for sentiment quantification.

This repository contains the code implementing the QuaNet model for quantification and everything needed to reproduce all experiments.

Run the script_experiments.sh script to generate all results.

We used three datasets: IMDB, HP and Kindle. The first one is automatically fetched from the Keras module. 
The HP and Kindle datasets can be downloaded from 
<a href=http://hlt.isti.cnr.it/quantification/data/quanet_hp_kindle_datasets.zip>here</a> and should be extracted in the
parent directory.
